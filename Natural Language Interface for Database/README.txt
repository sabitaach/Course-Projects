This project developed an interface for natural language queries for Winter Olympics and was evaluated on user question data. Given a query, Stanford Parser is used to obtain its dependency structure. All the necessary information required for creating a SQL query is extracted from the dependency structure and is plugged into SQL statements, which are then used for searching desired information from the database.
