Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_of_Russia	quotations	'My father was everything to me. Immersed in work as he was, he always spared that daily half-hour. � once my father showed me a very old album full of most exciting pen and ink sketches of an imaginary city called Mopsopolis, inhabited by Mopses. He showed it to me in secret, and I was thrilled to have him share his own childhood secrets with me.'
Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_of_Russia	quotations	'If Mrs. Anderson had indeed been Anastasia, Queen Marie would have recognized her on the spot. ... Marie would never have been shocked at anything, and a niece of mine would have known it. ... There is not one tittle of genuine evidence in the story. The woman keeps away from the one relative who would have been the first to recognize her, understand her desperate plight, and symphathize with her.'
Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_of_Russia	quotations	'My beloved Anastasia was fifteen when I saw her for the last time in the summer of 1916. She would have been twenty-four in 1925. I thought Mrs. Anderson looked much older than that. Of course, one had to make allowances for a very long illness ... All the same, my niece's features could not possibly have altered out of all recognition. The nose, the mouth, the eyes were all different. ... As soon as I sat down by that bed in the Mommsen Nursing Home, I knew I was looking at a stranger. � I had left Denmark with something of a hope in my heart. I left Berlin with all hope extinguished.'
Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_of_Russia	quotations	'Even during my geography and arithmetic lessons, I was allowed to sit with a pencil in my hand. I could listen much better when I was drawing corn or wild flowers.'
Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_of_Russia	quotations	'Yet I am sure that deep in her heart my mother had steeled herself to accept the truth some years before her death.'
Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_of_Russia	quotations	'Fortunately, I arrived just at that moment, picked her up and carried her back to Miss Eagar, who was still talking about Dreyfus.'
Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_of_Russia	quotations	'A moment later I remembered that the young woman having spent five years in Germany, would naturally have learnt the language, but then I heard that when she was rescued from that canal in 1920, she spoke nothing but German � when she spoke at all- which was not often.  I readily admit that a ghastly horror experienced in one�s youth can work havoc with one�s memory but I have never heard of any ghastly experience endowing anyone with a knowledge they had not had before it happened. My nieces knew no German at all. Mrs Anderson did not seem to understand a word of Russian or English, the two languages all the four sisters had spoken since babyhood. French came a little later, but German was never spoken in the family.'
