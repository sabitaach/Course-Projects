(1){{Infobox scientist}} (1)Agostino Bassi, sometimes called de Lodi (25 September 1773, near Lodi, Lombardy – 8 February 1856, in Lodi), was an Italian entomologist. 
(2) Agostino Bassi preceded Louis Pasteur in the discovery that microorganisms can be the cause of disease (the germ theory of disease). 
(3) Agostino Bassi discovered that the muscardine disease of silkworms was caused by a living, very small, parasitic organism, a fungus that would be named eventually Beauveria bassiana in Agostino Bassi honor. 
(4) In 1844, Agostino Bassi stated the idea that not only animal (insect), but also human diseases are caused by other living microorganisms; for example, measles, syphilis, and the plague. 
 
(5) Agostino Bassi was the son of a wealthy farmer and a lawyer who also had a passion for biology. 
(6) However, Agostino Bassi father did not want him to take up biology, but wanted him instead to look after the family's property, to become a civil servant and to join the Imperial administration. 
 
(7)Bassi did so, but also followed the lessons of Lazzaro Spallanzani, a relative, until Agostino Bassi died. 
(8) Agostino Bassi studies of 1807 concerned mal de segno (also known as muscardine, after a French candy), a lethal disease of domestic silkworms (Bombyx mori). 
(9) Infected caterpillars are covered with a fine white powder and die. 
(10) This disease initially appeared in Italy around 1805; then in France, by 1841. 
(11) After 1849, the silk farms were almost all abandoned because of this devastating disease. 
(12) The research to find the cause of this disease took him 25 years. 
(13) Bassi published the results of Agostino Bassi investigations in a paper entitled Del mal del segno, calcinaccio o moscardino (1835), stating that a living entity was the culprit, and that it was contagious; we now know that the powdery appearance on the killed silkworms is caused by the production of millions of infectious white fungal spores on the dead insect (see Beauveria bassiana). 
(14) Agostino Bassi is credited with rescuing the economically important silk industry, by recommendations like the use of disinfectants; separating the rows of feeding caterpillars; isolating and destroying infected caterpillars; and keeping the farms clean. 
(15) This brought Bassi immediate fame. 
(16) "Del Mal del Segno, Calcinaccio o Moscardino" was translated into French and distributed throughout Europe.[1] 
 
(17)From this work Agostino Bassi expanded on a theory explaining that many diseases of plants, animals and human beings were caused by pathogenic organisms. 
(18) Agostino Bassi thus preceded the work of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch. 
(19) Agostino Bassi was also the author of work on the culture of potatoes, on cheese, wine making, leprosy and cholera. 
(20) Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) was greatly influenced by Agostino Bassi work. 
(21) Pasteur had the portraits of both Spallanzani and Bassi in Agostino Bassi office.

(1){{Infobox Roman emperor}} (1)Diocletian ({{lang-la}};[1][2] c. 22 December 244[3] �–�3 December 311[4]), was a Roman Emperor from 284 to 305. 
(2) Born to a family of low status in the Roman province of Dalmatia, Diocletian rose through the ranks of the military to become cavalry commander to the Emperor Carus. 
(3) After the deaths of Carus and Diocletian son Numerian on campaign in Persia, Diocletian was proclaimed Emperor. 
(4) The title was also claimed by Carus' other surviving son, Carinus, but Diocletian defeated him in the Battle of the Margus. 
(5) Diocletian's reign stabilized the Empire and marks the end of the Crisis of the Third Century. 
(6) Diocletian appointed fellow officer Maximian Augustus Diocletian senior co-emperor in 285. 
 
(7)Diocletian delegated further on 1 March 293, appointing Galerius and Constantius as Caesars, junior co-emperors. 
(8) Under this "Tetrarchy", or "rule of four", each emperor would rule over a quarter-division of the Empire. 
(9) Diocletian secured the Empire's borders and purged it of all threats to Diocletian power. 
(10) Diocletian defeated the Sarmatians and Carpi during several campaigns between 285 and 299, the Alamanni in 288, and usurpers in Egypt between 297 and 298. 
(11) Galerius, aided by Diocletian, campaigned successfully against Sassanid Persia, the Empire's traditional enemy. 
(12) In 299 Diocletian sacked their capital, Ctesiphon. 
(13) Diocletian led the subsequent negotiations and achieved a lasting and favorable peace. 
(14) Diocletian separated and enlarged the Empire's civil and military services and reorganized the Empire's provincial divisions, establishing the largest and most bureaucratic government in the history of the Empire. 
(15) Diocletian established new administrative centers in Nicomedia, Mediolanum, Antioch, and Trier, closer to the Empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome had been. 
(16) Building on third-century trends towards absolutism, Diocletian styled himself an autocrat, elevating himself above the Empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. 
(17) Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's expenditures and necessitated a comprehensive tax reform. 
(18) From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more equitable, and levied at generally higher rates. 
 
(19)Not all of Diocletian's plans were successful: the Edict on Maximum Prices (301), Diocletian attempt to curb inflation via price controls, was counterproductive and quickly ignored. 
(20) Although effective while Diocletian ruled, Diocletian's Tetrarchic system collapsed after Diocletian abdication under the competing dynastic claims of Maxentius and Constantine, sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. 
(21) The Diocletianic Persecution (303–11), the Empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official persecution of Christianity, did not destroy the Empire's Christian community; indeed, after 324 Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under its first Christian emperor, Constantine. 
 
(22)In spite of Diocletian failures, Diocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government and helped stabilize the Empire economically and militarily, enabling the Empire to remain essentially intact for another hundred years despite having seemed near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth. 
(23) Weakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, and became the only Roman emperor to voluntarily abdicate the position. 
(24) Diocletian lived out Diocletian retirement in Diocletian palace on the Dalmatian coast, tending to Diocletian vegetable gardens. 
(25) Diocletian palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of Split.
